## What's Embedded Systems?

Embedded Systems are computing systems designed for specific tasks, typically with limited resources. They are integrated into various devices such as automobiles, medical equipment, and industrial machines.

## Why C?

C is a widely used programming language in the field of Embedded Systems due to its efficiency, portability, and direct access to hardware resources. It allows developers to write low-level code, control memory usage, and optimize performance.

## Variable Names

In C, variable names must follow certain rules:
- They should be a sequence of letters and digits.
- They must begin with a letter.
- They should not be a keyword (reserved word) in the language.
- Special characters like semicolons, periods, spaces, slashes, or commas are not permitted.

## Comments

Comments in C are used to provide explanations or document the code. There are two types of comments:

1. Single Line Comment:
   ```c
   // This is a single line comment
   ```

2. Multi-Line Comment:
   ```c
   /* 
      This is a
      multi-line comment
   */
   ```

## Data Types and Floating Point Types

C supports various data types:
- Integer types: `int`, `short`, `long`, `char`, etc.
- Floating-point types: `float`, `double`, `long double`, etc.

Each data type has a specific size and range, which you need to consider while working with variables.

can you predict x ?
   ```c
   short x = 32768 ;
   printf("%d" , x);
   ```
can you predict x ?
   ```c
   char x = 142 ;
   printf("%d" , x);
   ```
Can you tell me What is the size of int?
   The size of the int data type in C can vary depending on the platform and compiler being used. In most cases, the int data type has a size of 4 bytes     or 32 bits. However, it's important to note that the size of int can be different on different systems.
## Integer and Float Conversion

C provides automatic conversion between integers and floats when performing arithmetic operations. For example:
- `int / int` results in an `int`.
- `int / float` results in a `float`.
- `float / float` results in a `float`.
- `float / int` results in a `float`.

can you predict the result?
   ```c
   float x,y,z;
   int result;
   result = x*y*z /100 + 32/4 -3*1.1; 
   printf("%d",result);
   ```
so x equal to ?
   ```c
   float x = 2/3 +5;       VS      float x = 2/3.0 + 5;
   ```
Explicit conversion (type casting) can also be used to convert variables from one type to another.

## Type Conversion: Implicit, Explicit (Type Casting)

Type conversion in C can be either implicit or explicit. Implicit conversion occurs automatically, while explicit conversion (type casting) requires the programmer to specify the conversion explicitly.

The type conversion hierarchy in C is as follows: `char` -> `short` -> `int` -> `unsigned int` -> `long int` -> `unsigned long int` -> `float` -> `double` -> `long double`.
X,z?
   ```c
   int x = 10;
   char y = 'a'; //a in ASCII eual to 97
        
   x = x + y ;
   float z = x + 1.0 ;
   ```
sum ?
   ```c
   double x= 1.2 ;
   int sum = (int) x + 1;
   ```

## C Input/Output

C provides input and output (I/O) functions for reading and writing data. The most commonly used functions are `printf()` for output and `scanf()` for input. It's important to understand the format specifiers used with `printf()` to correctly print different data types.

basic operation >
   ```c
   int Tempreture;
   printf("Enter Tempreture");
   scanf("%d",&Tempreture);
   printf("Tempreture is : %d",Tempreture);
   ```
printf return ?
   ```c
   int x; 
   x = printf("hello IEEE\n");
   printf("%d",x);
   ```

## Mathematical & Logical Operations

C supports various mathematical and logical operations. Common operations include parentheses for grouping, division, multiplication, modulus, addition, and subtraction. It's important to consider the order of operations while performing complex calculations.

## Difference between Embedded Systems and Computers

Embedded Systems have specific constraints and requirements compared to general-purpose computers. They are designed for dedicated tasks, operate with limited resources, and often require real-time responsiveness.

## Advantages of C

C offers several advantages for embedded systems development:
- Optimization: C allows developers to write efficient and optimized code for resource-constrained systems.
- Portability: C programs can be written to be portable across different hardware platforms.
- Access to Hardware: C provides direct access to hardware resources, allowing low-level control and interaction.
- Integration with Assembly: C code can be easily integrated with assembly code, enabling fine-grained control and performance optimization.

## Data Types

Understanding data types is crucial in C programming. It includes knowing the size and range of each data type to ensure appropriate memory allocation and representation of values.

## How to Use bool in C?

In C99 and later versions, the `stdbool.h` library provides the `bool` type along with `true` and `false` constants. To use `bool` in C, include the `stdbool.h` header file in your program.

## Compiler Conversion

C compilers automatically perform type conversions during expressions and assignments. It's essential to understand how the compiler handles conversions between different data types to avoid unexpected results.

## Input/Output

C provides input/output functions (`printf()`, `scanf()`) for reading input from the user and displaying output. Understanding how to format data for input and output is crucial for effective communication with the user.

## Operations

C supports a wide range of operations, including mathematical and logical operations. Understanding the order of operations (`()`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `-`, `+`) ensures correct execution and desired results.

            ==> Correctly Execute
                () , / * % , - +
> i?
   ```c
   i = 2 * 3 / 4 + 4 / 4 + 8 - 2 + 5 / 8
   ```
>
   ```c
   x = ( x + y )* z                VS              x = x + y * z ;
   ```


## Post Increment vs Pre Increment

In C, the post-increment (`x++`) and pre-increment (`++x`) operators are used to increment the value of a variable. The difference lies in the order of operations and the value returned

>
   ```c
   int x =1;
   x++;
   ++x;
   printf("%d ",++x);
   ```
x,y ?
>
   ```c
   int x = 1;
   int y = 0;
   y = x++ + x++; 
   printf("%d , %d",x,y); .
   ```

## Right to Left or Left to Right
x?
   ```c
   int x = 10;
   printf("%d , %d",++x,x++);
   ```
C follows a specific order of evaluation for expressions. Understanding whether an expression is evaluated from right to left or left to right is crucial for determining the output.
